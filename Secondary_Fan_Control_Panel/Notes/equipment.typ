= Motor Starter
 - Single phase, 120VAC motor
 - Think I might go with Square D #link("https://www.se.com/us/en/product/8536SAO11V02S/nema-motor-starter-type-s-nonreversing-size-00-9a-1hp-at-230vac-5ka-sccr-1-phase-2-pole-melting-alloy-120vac-coil-open-taa/")[8536-SAO11V02S]
 - Need to figure out actual FLA and HP of motor to make sure this is an appropriately sized starter (takeoff states 1/4HP motor)

= Circuit Breaker
  - Can use a very similar style to what I typically use for 3-pole circuit breakers
  - Schneider Electric #link("https://www.se.com/us/en/product/BGL26015/circuit-breaker-powerpact-b-15a-2-pole-600y-347vac-18ka-lugs-thermal-magnetic-80/")[BGL26015]
